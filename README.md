Philips-Hue-Web-Interface
=========================

This is just my simple web interface for controlling my Philips Hue system at my house.  I keep an original Kindle Fire on my coffee table, so the layout is designed for it.  It also displays well on an iPhone.

All you need to do is replace the IP address of your Hue and the Hash value with your hash in the hue.js file and you're ready to go.

This will need to run on a internal web server at your house.  I'm sure with some creative forwarding and .htaccess work, you could make it external as well.
